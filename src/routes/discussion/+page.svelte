        <p class="mt-4">Generating concept images through AI rather than using real world materials. Simply.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Creating concept art is a time consuming and expensive process, each picture takes a lot of effort to produce, and most of them don't see the light of day. Our innovation aims to make this process more efficient. Our idea is to generate pictures using AI tools. The user gives the program a picture of a piece of furniture and in return gets the furniture in a new context, with new surroundings and a different appeal.</p>

        <h2 class="text-dark-400">Feasibility</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 font-bold">What are the potential barriers to implementation, including those related to sustainability, and how will you address them?</p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            The potential barriers to implementation of our solution is mostly caused by technical aspects. We do not have the time or the resources to train a model on strictly IKEA products or american kitchens. We also do not have powerful enough computers to generate really good pictures fast. These problems are close to impossible to completely solve for us, since they require resources we do not have. There should not be any real barriers related to sustainability since generating these pictures should always be more efficient than building a whole set etc.

        <p class="mt-4 font-bold">How does your innovation align with IKEA’s vision, business idea, sustainability strategy, and key values?</p>
        <p class="mt-4 font-bold">What unique value does your innovation offer compared to existing solutions in the market, particularly with regard to sustainability?</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Our “innovation” offers a much better/simplified interface specified for generating prompts that are “tailored” for changing the environment around the chosen IKEA product. It can be very challenging to find and use an AI that can generate good images, while still retaining the whole selected product.</p>
